<h2>What is pollution?</h2>

<div class="yap">
  <p>
    Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials (pollutants) wreck havoc on the environment, causing things like climate change, destroying ecosystems, and degrading soil quality. It also poses risks for human health, like causing respiratory issues, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer. There are different types of pollution that do different kinds of damage. Some pollution types are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Air Pollution</li>
    <li>Water Pollution</li>
    <li>Land Pollution</li>
    <li>Noise Pollution</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How can we fight pollution?</h2>

  <p> 
    In order to fight pollution, we need change. This change is both reliant on individual changes and systemic changes. We can contribute by practicing the 3 R's: reduce, reuse, and recycle. We can also adopt some habits, like turning off lights and electronics when not in use. These steps are crucial in order to create a healthier and more sustainable environment.Â
